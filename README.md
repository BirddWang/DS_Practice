# Data Structure
I want to build lots of basic structure in C.

## Hash part
there are a lot of bucket, we need to quickly find the bucket, and try to find the element in this bucket;

**it may be collision, overflow**

collision: H(x) = H(y) -> how to deal with this problem is one of the most problem in hashing
overflow: the H(x) bucket is full; (it can contain 3 elements, but come 4)
